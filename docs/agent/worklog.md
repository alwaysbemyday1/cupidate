### Task 2026-03-28-01 - App Modularization
Status: Completed

Changes:
- Split App UI and logic into feature modules under `src/features/app/`.
- Extracted state/logic from `App.tsx` into `useCupidateAppState`.
- Added per-view components (`HomeView`, `NetworkView`, `MatchingView`, `MyView`).
- Added reusable UI pieces (`PixelButton`, `SummaryCard`) and shared styles.

Verification:
- `npm.cmd test` passed.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed.

Notes:
- This sets up a clean boundary for upcoming repository/data-source integration.
